# polyfill-webcomponents

### Web Components Polyfills for use with [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).

This is the [Polymer Platform](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer) in a browserify-compatible package. This is not the full Polymer framework, just the platform, which provides the polyfills for next-generation web technology (plus some other stuff).

Polyfills will be regularly updated to latest development versions. As there is no sensible way to do semver, versions will be tagged by timestamp: `0.YYYYMMDD.patch`. Patch version may be incremented if there's a critical problem with the build.

## Installation

```
> npm install --save polyfill-webcomponents
```

## Usage

**See the [Getting Started](https://github.com/timoxley/polyfill-webcomponents/wiki/Getting-Started) guide for a step-by-step example.**

Use in-browser only with [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).

```js
// polyfill your browser environment
var Platform = require('polyfill-webcomponents')
// Platform is polymer's proprietary namespace, contains some helpers
```

Simply require polyfill-webcomponents anywhere your code needs webcomponent support.

You can safely require polyfill-webcomponents multiple times, it will only add the polyfills once.

### Use as a peer dependency

It is recommended to set `polyfill-webcomponents` as a [Peer Dependency](http://domenic.me/2013/02/08/peer-dependencies/) for anything except your top-level application.

Because `polyfill-webcomponents` necessarily modifies your global state, and will only load once, it doesn't make sense to have multiple copies bundled in your app. Peer dependencies allows a child modules to use the version loaded in the parent module.

Add this to your `package.json`:

```json
  "peerDependencies": {
    "polyfill-webcomponents": "*"
  },
```

## Documentation

See the documentation specifically for the **Platform** on the [Polymer website.](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/polymer.html)

## Features

Due to nature of the browser, proper encapsulation of these polyfills is not possible.
**This modifies your entire browser environment** with polyfills for:

* CustomElements
* ShadowDOM
* HTMLTemplates
* Model Driven Views
* WeakMap
* PointerEvents
* PointerGestures
* HTMLImports

Go to [polymer-project.org](http://www.polymer-project.org/) for API details.

## Browser Compatibility

This is alpha software. Support/performance is a bit fickle in everything but Chrome & Canary, and you may even experience dramatic differences between versions of Chrome. For best experience you'll want to at least enable:

* chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features
* chrome://flags/#enable-html-imports
* chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony

But remember to also test for degraded performance with these features off.

These polyfills work ([with caveats](http://www.polymer-project.org/compatibility.html)) in [Evergreen Browsers](http://tomdale.net/2013/05/evergreen-browsers/).

* Chrome
* Canary
* Chrome Android
* Firefox
* Safari 6+
* Mobile Safari
* Internet Explorer 10+

Do the web a favour, insist on only supporting Evergreen Browsers in your upcoming project.

[See Polymer's documentation for more information](http://www.polymer-project.org/compatibility.html).

## TODO

* Break these packages into more isolated components
* [Convince polymer team to publish these on npm themselves](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/326#)

## No Fork

If this package does not work as expected, let's work together to fix it; the last thing we need is
*more* random 3rd parties scattering unofficial Polymer pieces around npm.
